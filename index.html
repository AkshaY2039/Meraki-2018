    <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
    <p>There are some things that none of us can forget, that make us a part of who we are - the salty spray of the marina breeze, the rich aroma of filter coffee, the symphony of Carnatic music that makes you feel alive. We've stood huddled on sidewalks eating sundal wrapped in newspapers, took shelter from the rain that no one can foresee. The paradox of a city of rich culture and development at a speed like no other - we all know it because we live in it, day after day.<br><br> 

    There's a Madrasi that lies in every Chennai heart.<br><br>
    
    So keep your eyes wide open and set your soul free as we introduce you to a brand new twist to the long-cherished culture of IIITDM - the much awaited MERAKI 2018, our intra-institute cultural fest and the ultimate showdown to the end of our semester.<br><br> 
    MERAKI is a Greek word, which has no perfect translation. It means to pour your soul and love and creativity into whatever you do and to put a little bit of yourself out there where people can see it. This is the idea behind our cultural fest - a place where the love of art and culture and the urge to create can all come together. The fest will consist of a series of exciting events, workshops, and beat dropping DJ night, and to top it all off a lot of exciting prizes await those who participate!<br><br>

    <h1>SOCIAL CAUSE- FIGHT FOOD WASTE</h1>
    <p>As part of the IIITDM community, we want to focus on the conservation of resources and human effort, so through MERAKI 2018, we hope to accentuate the social issue of food waste.
